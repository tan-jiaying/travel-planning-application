# TripBuilder

This is a travel itinerary planning web application with auto route suggestion and scheduling features that has been developed for my Final Year Project. The primary goal of this application is to offer location recommendations for a chosen destination and automatically create an optimized itinerary for a trip based on a list of selected locations using an itinerary creation algorithm.
